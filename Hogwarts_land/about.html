                        The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is a chain of themed areas at Universal Parks & Resorts
                        based on the Harry Potter media franchise, adapting elements from the Warner Bros.' film
                        series and original novels by the creative mind of J. K. Rowling. The areas were designed by
                        Universal Creative from an exclusive license with Warner Bros. Entertainment, a WarnerMedia
                        company.

                        A Harry Potter-themed attraction at either a Disney or Universal park was rumored in 2003.
                        However, the rights to the Harry Potter franchise had been acquired by Warner Bros., who
                        denied all rumors. Both Disney and Universal entered bidding negotiations with Warner Bros.
                        and Rowling for the theme park rights to Harry Potter. In 2004, Rowling signed a
                        letter-of-intent with Disney, with the company intending to develop a Harry Potter section
                        within the Magic Kingdom park at Walt Disney World.
