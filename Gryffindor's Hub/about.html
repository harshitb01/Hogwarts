                The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is a chain of themed areas at Universal Parks & Resorts based on
                the Harry Potter media franchise, adapting elements from the Warner Bros.' film series and original
                novels by the creative mind of J. K. Rowling. The areas were designed by Universal Creative from an
                exclusive license with Warner Bros. Entertainment, a WarnerMedia company.

                A Harry Potter-themed attraction at either a Disney or Universal park was rumored in 2003. However,
                the rights to the Harry Potter franchise had been acquired by Warner Bros., who denied all rumors.
                Both Disney and Universal entered bidding negotiations with Warner Bros. and Rowling for the theme
                park rights to Harry Potter. In 2004, Rowling signed a letter-of-intent with Disney, with the
                company intending to develop a Harry Potter section within the Magic Kingdom park at Walt Disney
                World.
